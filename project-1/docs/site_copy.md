## Workforce Demand & Staffing Forecast Simulator
This project is a call-center analytics simulator that forecasts inbound demand (voice, chat, email), recommends staffing, and compares "what-if" scenarios to expose cost vs service tradeoffs.

### What it demonstrates
- Problem definition: staffing decisions are often reactive; this tool makes them measurable and scenario-driven.
- Data engineering: raw CSV ingestion, validation, cleaning, and building analytical fact tables.
- Modeling: baseline forecasts plus scenario multipliers, with accuracy metrics (MAPE, RMSE).
- Decision support: staffing gap heatmaps, SLA attainment, and labor cost variance.

### What to explore
- Switch granularity: 15m, 30m, 1h, 8h, 12h, 24h
- Compare scenarios: demand shifts, shrinkage changes, wage changes, staffing buffers
- See results by channel and queue
